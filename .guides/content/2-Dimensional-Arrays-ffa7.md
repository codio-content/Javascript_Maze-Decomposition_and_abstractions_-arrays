A 2 dimensional array is simply an array that where each arrays element contains another array. Thanks to our maze game, we actually have a really good example of a 2 dimensional array.

The image above shows our maze represented as blocks. To get information about any of the tiles (blocks) in our game, we can use an array like this ...

```javascript
tiles[2][1]
```

This gets information about the 3rd (remember that the 1st tile is element 0) tile from the left and the 2nd tile from the top.

Move to the next page for an explanation about the code on the left.
